# TODO #
- [x] implement s wrapping gsub
- [x] support g option for m using gregexpr, might not be simple to work out...
- [x] split function like perl's split?
- [x] tests
- [x] documentation
- [ ] any way to get the number of substitutions?  I don't think there is :(
- [ ] files, should be able to do similar to default perl
